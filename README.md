# CharacterCreator

A macOS SwiftUI tool for creating character prompts.

## Setup
The embedded data files are **not included** in this repository.  
Instead, template files are provided:

1. Copy the following templates and rename them:
   - `CharacterDataEmbedded.swift.template` → `CharacterDataEmbedded.swift`
   - `CharacterDataEmbeddedMale.swift.template` → `CharacterDataEmbeddedMale.swift`

2. Fill them with your actual data (see the JSON structure inside the templates).

## Notes
- Templates are included so contributors can see the structure and add their own data if needed.  
- Currently optimized for macOS (SwiftUI).
